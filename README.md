## Abstract 

A [bluetooth controlled tesla coil](https://www.amazon.com/Joytech-Bluetooth-Loudspeaker-Transmission-Experiment/dp/B08KDG6CFK/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jcJKfVIxfNRr2NYpISjmYrbMUUJ3lBEZphMIlKq8sg6zjZEekDJb9W24SPRy5rwD8pWmO0Qw2kqsUxoXW3BbQ604sA6yZjjdyAPkIhQYs-folgYbeQcCFXR0aduB3LFU8Lyu0xs-FqMQB9cuBs8yC1oDPR6SXmdb0cqRl93jRVKuO8ZMPxTWok0gZpAM6pvj0Gbqf_QJNVKl38TiKO_3N8x9LfDNSLLnbwStXQUxuzE.3JayxM7fZaikcn5mz6IQdINlx1W8vY8ROc_Jz39axT8&dib_tag=se&keywords=singing%2Btesla%2Bcoil&qid=1729105038&sr=8-1) was purchased off of amazon and the bluetooth chip was removed as well as the hardwired controller chip. 

Next, a STM32 nucleo development board was used to replace this chip using custom firmware to generate PWMs for the notes within the MIDI file for the hard real-time system to essentially allow for a custom command line controller.
